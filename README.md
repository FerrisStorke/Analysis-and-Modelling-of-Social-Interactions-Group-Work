## Topic description
In this project we are working on a network analysis in the field of football transfers. We want to analyze where the clubs buy and sell their players to and whether there is a connection/pattern.

## Setup and Installation
You can clone this repository to your computer using following command `git clone git@github.com:mateocolina/ams03-project.git`, please make sure that you are located in the right directory when you are cloning this repository.

Next, you will need to setup your Python environment using following command `python3 -m venv venv`. Now that your environment is set up, you will need to install the required packages. First, activate your newly created environment `source venv/bin/activate` and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Now your environment is completely set up.

## Git
As we are working simultaneously on the project we will need to work with Git Branches which will contain the code developments. To create a branch enter following command in your local Git repository `git checkout -b <name_of_branch>`. This will create a local branch on your computer. Once you finished your coding you must first add the changes to your commit with `git add .` and later `git commit -m "<your_message_what_has_changed>"`. Now your changes are committed but not yet pushed to GitHub. In order to do so, you only need to enter `git push`. Now your committed changes are pushed to the remote branch <name_of_branch>. You now need to merge your committed changes with the main repository on the web interface of GitHub. Follow the instructions on the web.
